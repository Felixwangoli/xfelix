Before 1861, Italy was a collections of city states, such as The Kingdom of two sicilies, Papal state and a bunch of Austria puppet states. 

When Napoleon was the emperor, the idea of being a republic was really attractive for 'Italians' since the invention of freedom, civil rights and etc. Therefore, a lot of republicans began to emerge and set out rebellions against the monarch at the time. However, Napoleon lost Waterloo war and France became an empire again. Therefore, the short-living Italian empire was stripped apart and became the way it was before. 

However, the Italians wouldn't give up like this. Almost all small states had some republicans wanted to reunite the Italy. However, it is hard to imagine how to unite a kingdom that was never united since Roman empire fell down. The first thing they did was culture influence. Instead calling themselves sicilians, they call themselves Italians and more importantly, the son of Romans. Therefore they justify their goal for unification: to make Italy great again! Then they used a lot of propaganda such as music, posters, writings, paintings and verbal speech. This was extremely successful at the time since the nationalism was very popular.

The first attempt they tried failed. When they invade papal state, French army got involved and kicked them out. But there was still much protest, the pope directly claimed that people there were not faithful and gave up several rebellious states under condition of keeping churches to Italy to reduce protest.

But they have no military power to do so. Back at the time, France and Austria were rivals to fight over the control of entire West Europe. Piedmont-Sardinia was an independent country lean towards France and joined a war with Russians. So she found out a great strategy--to persuade France to help Piedmont-Sardinia took back their land. In specific, they told French emperor those puppet states were controlled by Austrian and if he could kick Austria out of Italy, the France would gain advantage. Another strategy was that they sent a beautiful women to persuade the king. With the help from the French, Lombardy, Parma, Modena and Emilia were a piece of cake for Piedmont-Sardinia to took over. Austria lost its influence over Italy in 1855.


The next target was the Kingdom of The Two Sicilies. The people there was rebellious and there were the largest population and economy. However, it was hard to do so since the military was strong and iron-fisted. The revolutions were all resolved. However, the Bomb king dissolved his parliament and asked the navy to destroy the revolution. Then his son took over the place, witnessed the rebellious army. His son used Swiss mercenary to keep his throne. However Swiss army needed to go back once upon a time. That gave Italy opportunity to attack. But even with this advantage, Sicily was still hard to deal with. Therefore, Piedmont-Sardinia thought about their allies. France was busy dealing with Germany(Prussia) and Austria and had no interest in helping Italy for nothing. But Britain had great interest. In 1848, British colonised Egypt was commanded to build Suez canal for unprecedented transportation on mediterranean sea, which was dominated by Britain. However, to ensure a unblocked channel of cargo through mediterranean sea, the British wanted to lend a hand to Italy. In return, Piedmont-Sardinia Shall never charge a fee or stop British Cruise. With their help, The Kingdom of The Two Sicilies were also a part of Piedmont-Sardinia.

However, Austria still took control of North-east states in 1850s. However, Prussia was crushing Austria at the time and Austria wanted help from France and offered Venice. France had no interest in Venice but were willing to give it to Piedmont-Sardinia in exchange of two small regions in north west Piedmont-Sardinia. When Piedmont-Sardinia received Venice, she destroyed Austrian army there and took several land. 

Then their sole goal was to take papal state. Inside papal state, people still live under the rule by the pope and have no civil rights. But the whisper of revolution passed to the ears of people inside. They also wanted rebellion and republic. How pope dealt with rebellious state? He claimed that he was infallible and people were wrong to rebel against him. This of course did not work. However, Pope is the leader of Roman Catholic faith and Christian countries would help the pope. Therefore Italy did't try at the first place. But in 1870s Prussia-France war began and everybody took a side in the wars. Paris was captured therefore they took back their army in Papacy. This gave Italy a chance to invade. There were some volunteer to fight for the pope because of their faith, but they were too weak to fight against Italian army. Then Rome was also captured by Italy. Finally Rome and pope only kept Vatican.

Why did San Marino still exist until now. Because San Marino helped revolutionaries at the time and signed an independent contract.

The remaining Austria north state joined Italy in WWI as Austria broke apart. Italy reunited in 1918.
