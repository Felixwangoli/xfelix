### Bottom-up or top-down?
- A bottom-up democratic transition is one in which the people rise up to overthrow an authoritarian regime in a popular revolution. 
- A top-down democratic transition is one in which the dictatorial ruling elite introduces liberalizing reforms that ultimately lead to a democratic transition.

## Three waves of democracy
- First wave of democratisation 1828–1926 
- First reverse wave 1922–1942  
- Second wave of democratisation 1943–1962 
- Second reverse wave 1958–1975
- Third wave of democratisation 1974–

## Cases of Bottom up democratic transitions
### East Germany
#### Story
- East Germany in November 1989 protests on the streets of Leipzig and Berlin forced the Communist East German government to open up the Berlin Wall and allow free multiparty elections. 
- The end result was the emergence of a democratic East Germany and the eventual reunification of Germany in 1990.

##### Start from Gorbachev...
Before 1989, East Germany was a massively communist controlled stable place. Gorbachev was the chairman of Soviet Union at the time. He was facing two crisis: Economic stagnation due to invasion of Afghanistan in 1979; The 1986 Chernobyl disaster(a nuclear reactor exploded and spread radioactive fallout across much of Europe, revealed the dysfunctional nature of a deeply sclerotic and secretive Soviet state)

He took two policies: 
- Perestroika, or “economic restructuring,” was a reform policy aimed at liberalizing and regenerating the Soviet economy. 
- Glasnost, or “openness,” was a reform policy aimed at increasing political openness.

This caused people interpreting his action as leaning towards liberalism and capitalism, communism cannot defend its people! Therefore, rebel started.

##### The round talks
To start up, Polish government convened 'The Round Talks'. The result was legalization of the independent trade union and nationwide elections in 1989, which produced the first non-Communist prime minister in Eastern Europe in forty years.

##### Triangular Table Talks
Hungary talks caused 
- easing censorship and legalizing an independent trade union
- Communist Party renamed itself the Socialist Party, the country’s name was changed from the Hungarian People’s Republic to the Republic of Hungary, and multiparty elections were planned for 1990.

##### Breaching the Iron Curtain
After Hungary talk, some people from East Germany flee to West Germany. This phenomenon caused panic in the East Germany. A few rebel groups started to shout they wanted to leave the country, this eventually turned into “Wir bleiben hier!” (We are staying here!), which meant revolution was about to begin. By October 1989 more than 250,000 people were regularly taking part in pro-democracy demonstrations.

Despite protests, there were minor reforms since the people were armed against the government.

Finally, Gorbachev announced that Soviet would not help East European countries to remain communist. On November 4, more than one million East Germans took to the streets of East Berlin. In a final attempt to ward off ever larger protests, the East German government agreed on November 9 to remove all restrictions on travel to the West.

Reunification finally took place on October 3, 1990, when the areas of the former German Democratic Republic were incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany.

#### Insight
1. Bottom up transition
- Popular mobilization led to the overthrow of an authoritarian regime.
- Other examples: Czechoslovakia Velvet Revolution; Removing the Communist dictator Ceauşescu in Romania(December 1989); EDSA Revolution; June Resistance.

## Explanations for bottom-up transition
### Collective Action Theory
- The collective action, or free-rider, problem refers to the fact that individual members of a group often have little incentive to contribute to the provision of a public good that will benefit all members of the group.
- See([[Permanent-Notes/Economics/Microeconomics/Resource analysis/Types of good\|Types of good]]

#### Model

According to this theory, there are 2 equilibria
- Exactly K people participate, each of them are important
- No people participate

##### 4 important factors
- value of N-K
  - K = N->All groups are important->No free ride/No one participate if someone do not participate
  - K < N->Not all important->Free-rider incentive, F(Depend on the value of N-K, higher N-K, higher F)
- value of N
  - Higher N, higher F incentive to free ride.
- value of B
  - More benefit, more willing
- value of C
  - More cost, less willing

### Conclusions
- Small groups may exert very large influence on events
- Political leaders should try to convince people by saying K is significantly close to N, therefore people will value them as more important and participate.
- This explains why revolutions are so rare and some tacit consent may not be the case [[Permanent-Notes/Politics/Political Philosophy/Authority and Power/Social contract theory/Source of contract\|Source of contract]]
