## Do I Exist

### The evil demon hypothesis

To think what is the origin of his knowledge, we must start from scratch.

> _I will suppose therefore that not God, who is supremely good and the source of truth, but rather some malicious demon of the utmost power and cunning has employed all his energies in order to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, the air, the earth, colours, shapes, sounds and all external things are merely the delusions of dreams which he has devised to ensnare my judgment._

### Who am I? Am I exist? The solution to scepticism

<aside> 💡 Matrix and inception

</aside>

- Suppose I have no sense and body: **Cogito, ergo sum**, in other words, I think, therefore I am.

> _Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No: if I convinced myself of something then I certainly existed. But there is a deceiver of supreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving me. In that case I too undoubtedly exist, if he is deceiving me; and let him deceive me as much as he can, he will never bring it about that I am nothing so long as I think that I am something. So after considering everything very thoroughly, I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind._

### Where does other knowledge found?

- However, where does the knowledge of ourselves come from? Is it purely from imagination?

> _Thinking? At last I have discovered it -- thought; this alone is inseparable from me. I am, I exist -- that is certain. But for how long? For as long as I am thinking. For it could be, that were I totally to cease from thinking, I should totally cease to exist. . . I am, then, in the strict sense only a thing that thinks._

However, Descartes recognises that a conception of oneself as an embodied thing, living in an extended spatial world of physical objects, will come back almost irresistibly.

- Can we embody ourselves by sensation?

> _["I"]he residual taste is eliminated, the smell goes away, the colour changes, the shape is lost, the size increases; it becomes liquid and hot; you can hardly touch it, and if you strike it, it no longer makes a sound. But does the same wax remain? It must be admitted that it does; no one denies it, no one thinks otherwise. So what was it in the wax that I understood with such distinctness? Evidently none of the features which I arrived at by means of the senses; for whatever came under taste, smell, sight, touch or hearing has now altered -- yet the wax remains._

### Intellect Argument: The basis of Descartes rational argument

Intellect is the evidence that do not need proof, are naturally given.

**Therefore** he claims that there is a perception of the wax that is **"pure mental scrutiny"**, which can become "clear and distinct" depending on how careful he is to concentrate on what the wax consists in.

> _I now know that even bodies are not strictly perceived by the senses or the faculty of imagination but by the **intellect** alone, and that this perception derives not from their being touched or seen but from their being understood; and in view of this I know plainly that I can achieve an easier and more evident perception of my own mind than of any thing else_

### Motivation and the method of doubt: Rationalism

### Method of doubt:

> An argument is valid when there is no way -- meaning no possible way -- that the premises, or starting points, could be true without the conclusion being true. An argument is sound when the argument is valid and with a true premise

In other words, An argument is considered valid when the **premises logically lead to the conclusion,** meaning it is impossible for the premises to be true but the conclusion false. An argument is sound when it is both valid and all of its premises are factually true.

### Do the body exist?

> The senses sometimes deceive us. So for all we know, they always deceive us.

This is not a valid argument on its surface, however, with a a suppressed premise -- something needed to buttress an argument, and that its author might have presupposed, but does not state, we can make it valid

> The senses sometimes deceive us. **We cannot distinguish occasions when they do from ones when they do not.** So for all we know, any particular sense experience **may be** deceiving us.

- Now this is valid, but is it sound?
    - Is it true that we cannot tell that the senses are deceiving us?
        - Illusions are at first glance deceivable, but what if we give it enough time to distinguish between illusion and the truth?
            - Argument: Longer time scale can auto-correct the mistakes at the first glance.
                - Descartes answer is one of his presupposes: The way we recognise the mistakes or errors in long term and detailed sensation by using the very same senses
                    - May be add?
                        
                        we cannot distinguish even over time and with care whether our senses are deceiving us
                        
                        Or the senses can self-correct?
                        

### Is the world a dream?

- However, Descartes already anticipated this by using dream as an example: The dream looks real with real life components but nothing really is real.
    - We may argue that the **real world experience is more scaled and coherent** with no fallacies. However, what if the deception is simply too complicated?

### The Evil Demon Hypothesis lead to the conclusion

Hypothesis: There is an evil demon deceive me about everything, therefore the world is fake and my experience is not reliable. (scepticism)

Argument: I am thinking, therefore I am.

Way for approval: This claim is about deceive everything. However, I cannot be wrong that I think that I am thinking

<aside> 💡 I think that I exist. I am wrong about whether I do.

</aside>

This two cannot be both wrong.

- Another relevant thought experiment: The brain in a vat
    
    [Thought experiment «BRAIN IN A VAT» (English) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0sSJB1TrI)
    

<aside> 💡 Note: I am thinking, therefore I am only prove that I am conscious and this is without a doubt, this proves no possible explanation of physical being. However, if my thinking is a random process occuring and encoding the existing knowledge or experiences, am I being present? Imagine thinking is a process of organising electrical impulses and arrange informations, our thinking may deceive us. If I do not have the free will and the thinking is not lead by myself, can we still consider ourselves as being?

</aside>

### Descartes argument: I cannot doubt whether my mind exist, but I can doubt whether my body exist. Therefore, I am not a body. There must be a soul but not necessarily a body that exists

- **One objection:** Considering the parallel ‘Masked Man Fallacy’: I know who my father is. But I do not know who the masked man is. So my father is not the masked man.
- **Another objection:** German philosopher Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (1742- 99) remarked: "We should say, 'it thinks' just as we say, 'it thunders'. Even to say 'cogito' is too much, if we translate it with 'I think'.”
    - Not it thunders, thunders naturally going on. He claims therefore, I think, therefore I am is wrong because I may not exist, we can only prove that thoughts are actually happening in the world.

> **Descartes argument for sensation and thinking problem:** At a particular time, my senses inform me of a shape, colour, hardness, taste that belong to the wax. But at another time my senses inform me of a different shape etc. belonging to the wax. My senses show me nothing but these diverse qualities (which we can call "sensory qualities", since our senses take them in). I nevertheless make a judgement of identity: it is the same piece of wax on the earlier and the later occasion. So, it is the nature of the ball of wax that it can possess different sensory qualities at different times. So, to understand what the wax is I must use my understanding, not my senses.

### Do we have the self?

- Sensations are like messengers that needs interpretation from our own understanding. These requires elusive understanding of things and properties in the object, it is the same as we interpret ourselves, by recognising elusive things or causes(Intellect things). This is understood by self.

## However, how do we know beyond this?

How do we know beyond the demon proofed knowledge? i.e. Knowledge is acquired by natural intellect. Even reasoning may not be reliable.

### Rationalism for Descartes: The power of pure unaided reason, believing only clear and distinct ideas

- He, a mathematician, believes that a truth has to hold if it is clearly proven by reasoning or proof
    
- Knowledge achieved by this kind of rational insight is known as **"a priori"**: it can be seen to be true immediately, without any experience of the way of the world.
    
- Why it has to be distinct:
    
    [Rene Descartes, Sixth Meditation: Clear and Distinct Ideas (pt 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS96yLldxRs)
    

### The trademark argument

- He now have the argument for the self, now he needs a perfect cause for the idea of perfection for the self.
    - Why we need perfection? Because of **God.**
        
    - Reconstruction of Descartes argument:
        
        > I have the idea of a perfect being. This idea must have a cause. A cause must be at least as perfect as its effect. So something at least as perfect as my idea caused it. Therefore such a thing exists. But that thing must be perfect, that is, God.
        
    - God left the idea of perfection inside our mind. Therefore, deceiving as a bad virtue, god is perfect, therefore, God is no deceiver.
        
- Objections
    - Why everything must exist with a cause?
    - How can you have the clear and distinct idea of perfection when you are not perfect: Because it is really hard to define what is perfect.
        - Descartes answer
            - [W]e can touch a mountain with our hands but we cannot put our arms around it as we could put them around a tree or something else not too large for them. To grasp something is to embrace it in one's thought; to know something it is sufficient to touch it with one's thought.
            - We only comprehend a small portion of God’s trademark, we never know the full page. However, what we do know is sufficient to secure our understanding
            - However, this is not a good causation since most of them is not true→The cause will not resemble to the effect, it is not so easy to be predicable

### Cartesian Circle A disagreement of Descartes God argument.

If CDp→Tp, then G is true. However, only if we know G, CDp→Tp(p is any presuppose, CD is clear and distinct ideas, T is true, G is the existence of god and not deceive us)

- A counter argument would be that we do not need to know certain rules to understand that god exists It is like grammar, we may not know certain rules but we know that this is not right.
    - We may not know the mechanism but we can know the general rules, then by analysing the mechanism, we acquire the truth.
- However, I doubt the view of perfect cause
